bash looks icky so this is going to be done in ruby.

this script will do something with the most recently created file in said directory.

you will be able to specify your text editor of choice if your choice is one of the following: vim, vi, nano, ya know..

amongst those somethings that this script will do to that most recently created file..
--open it in a text editor
--tail it
--other stuff
